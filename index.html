	<p style="font-size: 20px;">If your taste in literature is trash written by a young queer autistic woman whose native language isn't even english, you've come to the right place. <strong>Indulge.</strong></p></center>
		<p style="text-indent: 25px;">Find me by viviv or dinospork elsewhere. I've written short stories, short novels and I'm on the process of writing a series. The series has an overarching theme of "collective" and "individual", exploring how each character sees these concepts even if subconsciously. That's just me making it sound fancy, though. To be honest, it's actually about a bunch of weird young people making terrible decisions and often falling in love.</p>

		<h3>Umbralverse series</h3>
			<h4><a href="#U1">In fear of being a tributary</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Laurel Greyland, next on the Ashen Valleys succession order, is sent on a somewhat diplomatic trip to their northern neighbors. His static notion of self gets fiddled with when he meets someone new. It's easy to see a reflection of his own loneliness in Siren, a bitter young mage.</p>
			<h4><a href="#U2">Forced landing</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Self-proclaimed greatest mage of the west coast, Morgiah has grown bored with her own mortality. The needs of the flesh are trivial and there is only one escape: getting rid of it and ascending to an undead state. To accomplish  that, she makes a pact with an otherworldly being. Ultimately, she is betrayed and stripped of her powers instead.</p>
			<h4><a href="#U3">Calm shores</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">With hardly a coin in the pockets of his cloak, refugee Jules tries to acquire enough to continue his trip the way he knows best: gambling. Over a few nights in a roadside inn, they lose the little they had, annoy the mysterious one-eyed waitress and get stabbed.</p>
			<h4><a href="#U4">Confluence</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Years after the events of "In fear of being a tributary", now Crown Princess Ember Greyland has her hand forced: she must marry the Lunarian heir and give up the Ashen Valleys' sovereignty to ameliorate the tensions.</p> 
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">This spins knight Cinder Ashling's life upside down. Being sworn to Ember since both girls were teenagers, she's kept her love for her a secret and convinced herself that simply being by her side was enough. However, watching Ember give herself and the country to someone else is an experience she'd like to avoid.</p>
			<h4><a href="#U5">Going to whatever</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Led to her breaking point after years of bouncing between Lunar Bay towns, Moss swears she'll create a better living option through nails and teeth. However, she's all alone and acutely aware of it. Meeting war defector and gladiator Corvin is the first step in finding strength through numbers. After watching Corvin get brutalized, she tries to convince them that she has the answer. <strong>CW: ableism suffered by MC</strong></p> 
			<h4><a href="#U6">Fracture</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Many years after the last work set in the universe, the continent has reached the industrial era. Lunarian influence has spread to the far east, drastically reshaping the daily lives of the local populace. Nicola, being born after total occupation, is accustomed to these changes — and to viewing the world around her through Lunarian lenses. However, a rather unfortunate event uproots her from her home and makes her collide with an odd figure from a bygone era, clad in worn armor from head to toe. Naturally prone to questioning and investigating what she doesn't understand, she wants to dissect her savior before setting her life back en route.</p>
		<h3>Assorted stories</h3>
			<h4><a href="#A1">Seeping through</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Having studied in a prison turned military school her whole life, Casey is now a teacher to students that are as trapped there as she is. Seeing no life prospects, she goes through her days mindlessly, blank on the outside and bleak on the inside. A call of the void in the form of an intrusive thought leads her to the display of a dormant mimic — a flesh eating monster — in the basement.</p>
			<h4><a href="#A2">Spring comes every year</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">Already dead Gael is risen for futile reasons by a fellow cleric, which means she gets to see a place she used to be very familiar with again; however, she feels like only a day has gone by. To make matters worse, a person who she died hoping not to see again is still there. With her extra days, she is forced to witness the mundane aspects of the world after her death.</p>
			<h4><a href="#A3">Summer turns to fall</a></h4>
			<p style="margin-left: 25px;">A short-story in the same universe as "Spring comes every year". Sabrael's Morgana has finally concluded her training as a cleric. Now, she has her whole life ahead of her; she even managed to get the assignment she'd been hoping to. All she has to do is carry out her duties and keep her vow of abstaining from romance, which isn't much of an issue for a self-described loner.</p>
